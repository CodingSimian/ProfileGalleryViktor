This is a project that I wrote as part of a recruiting process for a possible internship. Keep in mind that this is my first ever javascript project,
and I am certain that there are many areas of my code which is lacking. Nevertheless, this was very fun to work on
and familiar compared to java!

It's a simple webpage displaying randomized information with a simple pagination and age-filter features. Hope you enjoy!
